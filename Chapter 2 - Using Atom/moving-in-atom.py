'''
Atom has support for all the standard Linux cursor movement key combinations. To
go up, down, left or right a single character you can use the arrow keys.

In addition to single character movement, there are a number of other movement
keybindings:

Ctrl+Left - Move to the beginning of word
    Ctrl+Right - Move to the end of word
    Home - Move to the first character of the current line
    End - Move to the end of the line
    Ctrl+Home - Move to the top of the file
    Ctrl+End - Move to the bottom of the file

You can also move directly to a specific line (and column) number with Ctrl+G

Navigating by Symbols

You can also jump around a little more informatively with the Symbols View. To
jump to a symbol such as a method definition, press Ctrl+R. This opens a list of
all symbols in the current file, which you can fuzzy filter similarly to Ctrl+T.
You can also search for symbols across your project but it requires a tags file.

Bookmarks

Atom also has a great way to bookmark specific lines in your project so you can
jump back to them quickly.

If you press Ctrl+Shift+F2, Atom will toggle a "bookmark" on the current line.
You can set these throughout your project and use them to quickly find and jump
to important lines of your project. A small bookmark symbol is added to the line
gutter.

If you hit F2, Atom will jump to the next bookmark in the file you currently
have focused. If you use Shift+F2 it will cycle backwards through them instead.

You can also see a list of all your project's current bookmarks and quickly
filter them and jump to any of them by hitting Ctrl+F2.
