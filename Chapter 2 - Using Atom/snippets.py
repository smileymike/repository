# snippets.py
# Snippets are an incredibly powerful way to quickly generate commonly needed
# code syntax from a shortcut.

# e.g.
# You create new html file, then tab, a snippet of:
'''
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
'''
# pops up and fill in automatically saving few keystrokes

# Then more Snippets using Command Palette (Ctrl + Shfit + P) and type:
# "Snippets: Available" which shows html tags

# Create your Own Snippets
# there is a text file in your ~/.atom directory called snippets.cson that
# contain all your custom snippets that are loaded when you launch Atom.
# Also easily accessed via "Edit -> Snippets..."

# For more examples, see the snippets in the language-python package.
