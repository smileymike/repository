'''"Pending Pane Items" were formerly referred to as "Preview Tabs"

When you open a new file by single-clicking in the Tree View, it will open in a
new tab with an italic title. This indicates that the file is "pending". When a
file is pending, it will be replaced by the next pending file that is opened.
This allows you to click through a bunch of files to find something without
having to go back and close them all.
